# Basic Profiling

In this exercise you need to implement a basic measurement of the execution time for a kernel performing matrix-matrix multiplication.  Compute the executiomn time of the kernel by taking the diffference between the start of the execution time and sta `sycl::event` class to extract this info by computine
